		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Register @dspy Chat Participant",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the registration process into defining participant metadata and implementing a basic handler function that logs a message.",
			"reasoning": "This task is straightforward as it primarily involves calling a single VS Code API with predefined parameters. The complexity comes from ensuring the handler is correctly wired up."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement VSCodeLMProvider Adapter for Ax",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the subtasks for creating the class structure, implementing model selection, handling chat requests (including streaming), and managing error conditions.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires understanding both the Ax provider interface and the VS Code `vscode.lm` API, including handling asynchronous streaming responses and potential errors. It's a core integration piece."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Context Collection from Editor",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Outline subtasks for checking active editor, handling selection vs. full file content, and retrieving file path.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves conditional logic based on editor state (selection vs. no selection) and accessing VS Code API properties. It's relatively contained but crucial for context."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Define Ax Signatures and Pipeline for Reasoning Loop",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Specify subtasks for defining each individual Ax signature (Plan, Draft, Critique) with their respective inputs/outputs, then constructing the overall Ax pipeline, and finally, creating mock tests for each signature and the pipeline.",
			"reasoning": "This is a design-heavy task that requires a deep understanding of Ax's signature and pipeline concepts. It involves defining the core logic flow and data structures for the LLM interactions, which can be iterative and complex to get right."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Ax Pipeline with Chat Participant",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the integration into passing user query and context to the pipeline, configuring the pipeline with the custom LM provider, and capturing the final output.",
			"reasoning": "This task connects the previously developed components. While it uses existing pieces, ensuring correct data flow and configuration between the chat participant and the Ax pipeline adds moderate complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Stream Ax Pipeline Output to Chat",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail subtasks for identifying key output stages from the Ax pipeline, formatting each stage's output into markdown, and incrementally sending these formatted responses to the chat using VS Code's streaming API.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves real-time output formatting and streaming, which can be tricky to implement correctly for a smooth user experience. It requires careful handling of intermediate results from the Ax pipeline."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement 'Insert to Editor' Quick Action",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Outline subtasks for creating the quick action UI element, handling the click event, and using `vscode.window.activeTextEditor.edit` to apply the code.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves UI interaction and editor manipulation. While the API for inserting text is straightforward, ensuring the action appears correctly and handles various editor states (selection, cursor position) adds some complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Context Referencing in Output",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for modifying prompt engineering to include context and formatting the initial chat response to display the context source.",
			"reasoning": "This task is about enhancing the user experience by making the LLM's awareness of context explicit. It involves minor adjustments to prompt engineering or output formatting, but requires careful placement."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Document Extension Usage and Roadmap",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail subtasks for outlining the README structure, writing usage instructions, and documenting the architecture and future roadmap.",
			"reasoning": "This is a documentation task. While important, it doesn't involve coding or complex technical implementation, making its complexity relatively low."
